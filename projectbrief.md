# Project Brief: Next.js Blog Template with Integrated CMS

## Overview

This project aims to build a blog template that allows any user to quickly set up and manage their blog using Next.js. The template is built on the create-t3-app framework, combining TRPC for API handling, NextAuth for authentication, and a custom integrated CMS for managing content without redirecting users to an external platform.

## Objectives

- Provide a turnkey and customizable blog solution with an integrated CMS.
- Enable users to manage blog content seamlessly with a unified admin and public interface.
- Leverage Next.js features for high performance, SEO, and scalability.
- Ensure a smooth user experience by integrating NextAuth for authentication and using familiar tools and patterns.
- Use Quill as the rich text editor to allow rich text formatting, image insertion, and essential editing functionalities like undo/redo.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Public-Facing Blog

- **Home Page:** Displays a list of blog posts including title, summary, publication date, and a thumbnail. Supports pagination or infinite scrolling.
- **Single Post Page:** Dedicated page for each blog post with complete content rendered. Supports markdown/MDX for content flexibility.
- **SEO and Social Integration:** Dynamic meta tags, Open Graph, and Twitter Cards configuration for enhanced social sharing experience.

### 2. Integrated Admin CMS

- **Authentication & Authorization:** Uses NextAuth to manage secure logins, with role-based access control (e.g., Admin, Editor).
- **Dashboard:** Provides an overview of recent posts, drafts, and published articles.
- **Rich Text Editor:** Integrated editor using Quill for writing and editing posts, including features like undo/redo, image support, and inline preview.
- **Content Management:** Facilities for creating, editing, previewing, and publishing posts; includes support for drafts and version control.
- **Media Manager:** Allows image uploads and file management, with integration to support uploading and embedding media in posts.
- **SEO Fields:** Customizable fields for meta titles, descriptions, and social media settings for each post.

### 3. Backend Services

- **Database Models:** Using Prisma ORM with models such as User, Post, and Media. Posts include fields for title, content, summary, status (draft/published), and timestamps.
- **TRPC API Endpoints:** Create endpoints for CRUD operations on posts and media management. Use middleware to ensure routes are protected based on user roles.
- **Authentication Integration:** Enforce secure access to admin and API operations through NextAuth session management.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Utilize Next.js capabilities with Static Site Generation (SSG) and Server Side Rendering (SSR) to ensure fast load times.
- **Security:** Enforce secure API endpoints and protect against common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF) with robust authentication and authorization measures.
- **Scalability and Maintainability:** Implement a clean, modular code architecture to ensure the project scales well with future enhancements and is easy to maintain.
- **Responsive Design & Accessibility:** Ensure both public and admin interfaces are responsive and follow accessibility standards.

## Tech Stack & Tooling

- **Framework:** Next.js (create-t3-app)
- **API Layer:** TRPC
- **Authentication:** NextAuth
- **ORM:** Prisma
- **Rich Text Editor:** Quill
- **Package Manager:** pnpm
- **Deployment:** Platforms such as Vercel or Netlify

## Future Enhancements

- **Plugin/Extension System:** Allow advanced users to add custom functionalities or components.
- **Internationalization (i18n):** Support multi-language capabilities to expand global reach.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Add offline support and an app-like experience for users.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Integrate deeper analytics to track user engagement and content performance.

## Summary

This project serves as an all-in-one blog template that offers both public-facing blog features and an integrated CMS for content management. With a focus on performance, security, and user experience, the template leverages modern technologies such as Next.js, TRPC, NextAuth, and Quill to deliver a cohesive and scalable solution for bloggers.
