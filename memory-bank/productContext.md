# Product Context

This project exists to provide a seamless, integrated blog experience that combines a public-facing blog with an easy-to-use CMS. By consolidating both interfaces in one cohesive system, the project addresses the challenges of managing separate admin and client systems while ensuring high performance and a great user experience.

The solution aims to simplify blog setup and management, leveraging Next.js for optimal performance, NextAuth for secure authentication, TRPC for API handling, and Quill for rich text editing.

It is designed to be turnkey and customizable, catering to both technical and non-technical users.
